        Two variants of streamed data loaders are provided:
        -   `<streamed-data-loader>` - data is organized as a stream of
            Newline-Delimited JSON (NDJSON) objects
        -   `<updating-streamed-data-loader>` - handles same data source
            as `<streamed-data-loader>`,  updates data in response to
            change events
    children:
      - StreamedDataLoader
      - UpdatingStreamedDataLoader

        The package also includes a handful of support classes. The
        `SharedEventSource` class allows sharing of `EventSource`
        instances among multiple listeners. The `PooledDataRequestMixin`
        provides queueing of `fetch()` requests so as to limit the
        number of concurrently active requests. The
        `UpdatingDataLoaderMixin` triggers updates when data changes.
    children:
      - PooledDataRequestMixin
      - SharedEventSource
      - UpdatingDataLoaderMixin
